# lc0-testing
testing framework that is designed to be used by lc0 users

## setup ##
you would need to do some steps to use this framework:
1. add users at (defaults to) http://localhost:15672/#/users with your desired passwords (I used administrator, check what fits your needs) and remove the guest one.
2. for "production", you would need to change all "localhost" in files to your host. 
3. wait for me to finish serve.py
